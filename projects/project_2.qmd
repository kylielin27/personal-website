# Project Description

I conducted a study on a virtual island to see the effects of various factors on cognition. I studied the effects of drug use, exercise, gender, and diet on cognition. I then conducted a two-way ANOVA to determine if there was a significant difference before and after the treatments were administered. I created a multiple linear regression model to analyze the significant variables.

# Results

I found that there was a significant difference before and after the treatments were administered. I determined the most significant factors on cognition to be diet, gender, and the interaction between diet and gender.
