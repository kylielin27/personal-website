# Project Description

I worked with a team to analyze a dataset containing various variables for different countries and their life expectancy. We created a multiple linear regression model in R to determine what factors most contributed to life expectancy. We also created plots in R to display our model and the data.

# Results

Through our analysis, we found the most significant factors that impact life expectancy to be alcohol use, BMI, GDP, education, and Population.
