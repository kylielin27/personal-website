# Project Description

I worked with a team to analyze a dataset on obesity and create a model to predict the obesity status of individuals. We created various models to accurately predict obesity. 

# Results

Out of the models we created, we found the most accurate one to be a random forest model with feature importance. We used 16 variables from the dataset in our model. They were Race, Height, Age, FAF, MTRANS, CH2O, family_history_with_overweight, CALC, TUE, FCVC, NCP, CAEC, FAVC, Gender, SCC, and ever_married.
